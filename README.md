## 🚀 Assessment 3: Advanced Python Coding Challenges 🐍

# 💡 Overview

I recently completed my third Python coding assessment, focusing on advanced problem-solving techniques, efficient data handling, and real-world applications. This assessment builds upon previous concepts and integrates powerful Python libraries for enhanced performance and scalability.

# 🔍 What's Inside?

✅ Complex algorithmic challenges with optimized solutions

✅ Efficient use of Python libraries for performance gains

✅ Clear explanations and expected outputs for validation

# 📌 Topics Covered:

🔹 Algorithm Optimization – Enhancing time & space complexity

🔹 Data Structures – Lists, dictionaries, sets, heaps, and queues

🔹 Recursion & Iteration – Solving problems efficiently

🔹 Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, collections, itertools, functools

# 💑 Tasks Included:

🔸 Optimizing sorting & searching algorithms

🔸 Implementing dynamic programming solutions

🔸 Working with large datasets using pandas

🔸 Leveraging itertools for combinatorial problems

🔸 Using functools for memoization and performance improvement

# 💡 Why This Matters

This assessment challenged me to think critically, apply Pythonic best practices, and utilize libraries for real-world applications.
